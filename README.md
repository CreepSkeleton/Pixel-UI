# About Pixel UI:
Pixel UI gives *Minecraft* a completely new UI.
You may have noticed that it looks a bit similar to *minecraft.net*, and that's because the pack is mostly inspired by it!
Not only that, but it takes some aspects from other *Minecraft* editions!

# Trivia:
- Pixel UI originally started as a way for me to learn JSON UI and UI design.
- Pixel UI's title menu is inspired by the menu seen in dotJS's video "Adding JavaScript to Minecraft"
